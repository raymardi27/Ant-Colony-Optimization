# Ant-Colony-Optimization

A repo containing code for the Ant Colony Optimization Mini Lecture as a part of CSCI 650

It is also a foray into using the Manim animation Library to figure out how to animate Science Videos using Python code.

Compile the files using: `manim -pql <fileName> <className>` to generate the animations.
Replace `pql` with `pqh` to switch to high quality.

## Requirements

Install Manim using: `pip3 install manim`
The support is only for Debian Linux Systems
Install texlive (for Linux) using: `sudo apt install texlive-full`.
